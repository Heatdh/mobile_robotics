## Groupe 27 project
the readme file will be updated progressively throughout the project. 

Session Nov 15:
Didnt make too many changes, settled with Noah doing Vision, Severin doing path planning (global nav), Cameron doing motion control (following the path provided by Severin)

What still needs to be done : local navigation, filtering (use of Kalman filter for example)(for now we think we don't need the cameras feedback to correct trajectory of robot, but if we see we will need it, will have to implement tracking/template matching and )
What Rayen can do : look into Filtering and local navigation (or help Noah out for image processing)
