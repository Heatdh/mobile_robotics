## A simple obstacle avoidance
This is just to test and will be expanded. 
We need to have different states to exploit the sensor data. First an idle state where the robot waits for the gloabal navigation and path. then perfect_state, the robot is following the actual path and everything goes smoothly. An avoid obstacle state: here it will be divided based on a threshold and the manoeuvers possible based on the distance as in some cases if you are trapped, it is inavoidable to do inplace movements (not hard to implement/ we have done similiar just a small expension on setting the speed). The most significan state *rejoin optimal path* to go back to our path after successfully avoiding the obstacle with *minimum deviation* from the optimal path
